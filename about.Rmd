  I'm not entirely sure what I'll do with this website. Perhaps I'll rename this section from "About" to "Projects," and then I will add some small projects that'll include R code, graphics, and some commentary. Nothing too fancy and nothing not not fancy... amazing English. 
  
  I suppose that this is an about page, for now, so a little about me -- I like hamsters. The little ones a pretty cute.
